Sam认为hire是startup最重要得事情，并在本文中给出了一些自己得建议：

* Spend more time on it.
* In the beginning, get your hands dirty.(learn that role)
* Look for smart, effective people.
* Have people audition for roles instead of interviewing for them.
* Focus on the right ways to source candidates.(use your personal networks more)
* Have a mission, and don’t be surprised at how much selling you’ll have to do.
* Hire people you like.(Sunday test)
* Have a set of cultural values you hire for.
* Don’t compromise.
* Be generous with compensation packages, but mostly with equity.
* Watch out for red flags and trust your gut.
* Always be recruiting.
* Fire fast.
* Put a little bit of rigor around the hiring process.
* Don’t hire.(不要为了招聘而招聘)
