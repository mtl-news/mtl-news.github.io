摘读：

Startup融资一般有三个阶段：

* *Phase 1*: get started with a few tens of thousands from something like Y Combinator or individual angels
* *Phase 2*: raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company
* *Phase 3*: once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or more later rounds to accelerate growth

这篇文章Paul Graham建议founder在Phase2的时候：

****
Avoid investors till you decide to raise money, and then when you do, talk to them all in parallel, prioritized by expected value, and accept offers greedily. 
****

对于上述的建议，Paul Graham对每一个细节都进行了详细的描述：

* *Force* (You wouldn't need a rule to keep you going in one direction if there weren't powerful forces pushing you in another)
* *Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you*
* *Be in fundraising mode or not*
* *Get introductions to investors*
* *Hear no till you hear yes* (Treat investors as saying no till they unequivocally say yes)
* *Do breadth-first search weighted by expected value*
* *Know where you stand*
* *Get the first commitment*
* *Close committed money*
* *Avoid investors who don't "lead"* (the expected value of an investor who won't "lead" is zero)
* *Have multiple plans* (Different plans match different investors)
* *Underestimate how much you want*
* *Be profitable if you can*
* *Don't optimize for valuation*
* *Yes/no before valuation* (告诉investor自己并没有仔细思考valuation，现在只是想找个investor partner)
* *Beware "valuation sensitive" investors*
* *Accept offers greedily*
* *Don't sell more than 25% in phase 2*
* *Have one person handle fundraising* (就是CEO)
* *You'll need an executive summary and (maybe) a deck*
* *Stop fundraising when it stops working* (Don't keep sucking on the straw if you're just getting air)
* *Don't raise too much* (融资越多，下一轮融资压力越大)
* *Be nice* (never to seem arrogant at all)
* *The bar will be higher next time*
* *Don't make things complicated*
