摘读：

*The key to reaching the advanced level and feeling like you were born to be CEO is mastering the unnatural.*

作为一个CEO需要许多的unnatural motion，为了长久的利益，你必须作出这些可能upset people的unnatural motion。Giving feedback在平常的生活中，会显得bizarre，不过这是*unnatural atomic building block atop which the unnatural skill set of management gets built*

一个对于初学者有效的feedback方法--*The shit sandwich*:
****
The basic idea is that people open up to feedback far more if you start by complimenting them (slice of bread #1), then you give them the difficult message (the shit), then wrap up by reminding them how much you value their strengths (slice of bread #2)
****

不过The shit sandwhich并非有效，而且可能会带来一些负面效果，因而我们需要采取一些灵活的方法来giving feedback:

* Be authentic
* Come from the right place
* Don’t get personal
* Don’t clown people in front of their peers
* Feedback is not one size fits all
